# Neural Network-based Structured Model Predictive Control (NN-SMPC) Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Neural Network-based Structured Model Predictive Control system for a mass-spring-damper plane model. The project demonstrates how neural networks can be integrated within a structured MPC framework to enhance prediction capabilities while maintaining the explicit handling of constraints and system structure. This approach differs from vanilla MPC by incorporating neural networks to capture complex nonlinear dynamics while preserving the structured optimization problem formulation that is central to MPC.
